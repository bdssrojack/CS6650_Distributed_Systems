### Assignment overview
This assignment required us to implement a simple client-server interactive program using TCP and UDP as the L4 protocol and Java as the programming language.
It requires the fully understanding of how TCP and UDP works and the usage of according packages in Java. Through this project, I got familiar with Java network programming
 and enhanced the proficiency of object-oriented design. The most important purpose of this project in my opinion is give us students a basic feeling of inter-process 
communication. It also requires human-readable log for any exception case, which is a great practice for industrial standard programming.


### Technical impression

I personally appreciate the project proposal, it provided a first glance of how two process can interact with each other by network and 
specified protocol. It also offered a chance to expertize Java programming and object-oriented design. 
However, I think there are some parts of this assignment could be improved. 1. the requirement in the proposal seems vague. For example, 
we're asked to include two instances of server and client respectively, and the command line arguments don't cover the specifier of protocol.
So how can we know which protocol to use? 2. The requirement for log is not clear, it didn't specify where to dump the log, either standard out or
log file. 3. the scope of this project is a little bit narrow. It doesn't mean the learning curve has to be steep for the first project, but as a master level course,
it should cover more advanced topics such as what's going to be covered in the second project, it's a great opportunity to start working on multi-thread programming
and RPC for distributed system.
